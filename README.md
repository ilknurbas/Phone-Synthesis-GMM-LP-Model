# Phone-Synthesis-GMM-LP-Model
 This repository contains materials for a task focusing on statistical parametric phone synthesis using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Linear Prediction (LP). The task involves **synthesizing speech sounds by modeling different speech sounds using GMMs based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are extracted from the LibriSpeech dataset**. The GMM model is used to sample feature vectors for the desired speech sounds, which are then converted into LP coefficients. These LP coefficients are paired with an excitation signal, such as an impulse train or a glottis signal, to generate audible speech. Tasks include training GMM models, extracting MFCC features, generating LP parameters, and synthesizing the speech sounds, with MATLAB as the main tool for analysis and synthesis. *Note that some sections of the codes are based on templates provided.*
